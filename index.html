                        <p>Learning from his experiences, Evan was assigned to assist with an experimental project that combined six interns into a single team to create production applications. The team was one of the first of its kind at State Farm and serves as a model for software development teams in the internship program today. During his time with Team WinTerns (as they named themselves) Evan was given the chance to learn React.JS and develop a web application that could dynamically fetch information about different resources provisioned to test areas throughout State Farm. It was during this time first began to work with Unit and Integration tests, and served as a Scrum Master in addition to his work as a developer.</p>

                        <p>At the begining of the 2019 internship program Evan was approached by his manager, the person responsible for overseeing the Enterprise technology intern program in Bloomington, to be placed in an area that usually did not request interns. Evan, very interested in learning something new, accepted the offer and joined the Search Team at the begining of June 2019. During this time, Evan lead an Enterprise Wide project known as Product Local Landing Pages, in which State Farm generated unique localized content for SEO on over 6,000 pages located in cities across the United States. The pages drove thousands of quotes to State Farm, and Evan was given an award by the manager of the Search Team for his role in leading the effort. Evan is currently continuing his work with the team by leading a Page Speed Improvement effort across the entire <a href="https://www.statefarm.com/" title='The State Farm Website Homepage'>StateFarm.com website.</a></p>
